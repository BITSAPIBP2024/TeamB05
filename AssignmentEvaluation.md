# Project Evaluation 

## 1. Team A01
#### 1. Overview
The primary goals of the APIs in this project are to provide a robust and secure mechanism for managing gold provenance and verification using blockchain technology. The APIs are used to support the entire lifecycle of gold transactions, from registration to verification and transfer The APIs are designed to facilitate interactions between different roles in the system, namely "Buyers" and "Sellers." These roles are differentiated through JWT tokens, allowing for secure and role-based access to various functionalities. The APIs ensure the authenticity and traceability of gold by allowing Sellers to register gold on the blockchain, and enabling Buyers to verify and transfer gold securely.

#### 2. Tech Stack

- **JavaScript (72.4%)**: Primarily used for developing the API logic, possibly using Node.js for server-side scripting and Express.js for routing.
- **CSS (22.6%)**: For styling any web interfaces that interact with the APIs.
- **Solidity (3.4%)**: Used for writing smart contracts, which could be integrated with the APIs for blockchain interaction.
- **HTML (1.6%)**: To structure the web content that interacts with the APIs.

#### 3. Key Features

- **RESTful API Endpoints**: For various CRUD operations, enabling interactions with the backend database.
- **Smart Contract Integration**: APIs that interact with Ethereum blockchain through Solidity smart contracts.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Responsive Web Interface**: Web interfaces styled with CSS to ensure responsiveness and usability across different devices.

#### 4. Use Cases

- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: APIs for financial transactions involving smart contracts for secure and transparent operations.
- **Web Applications**: APIs that serve as the backend for web applications, providing functionalities such as data retrieval, user management, and content delivery.
- **Educational Tools**: Demonstrating API development and blockchain integration for educational purposes in an academic setting.

#### 5. Areas of Improvement

- **Documentation**: Comprehensive and clear documentation can greatly aid new contributors and users in understanding the projectâ€™s functionality and setup processes.
- **Testing**: Implementing robust testing frameworks and ensuring high test coverage can improve the reliability and stability of the APIs.
- **User Experience (UX)**: Regular updates and feedback collection from users can help in refining the interface and ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Security Audits**: Given the use of Solidity and potential blockchain elements, regular security audits can help in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
