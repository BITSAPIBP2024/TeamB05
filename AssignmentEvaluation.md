#### 1. Overview
The Dynamic Blog API is a highly scalable and feature-rich solution designed for managing blog posts within an organization. It supports robust role-based authorization with JWT authentication, allowing admins to manage blog content and users to interact with it seamlessly. The API includes advanced features like pagination, sorting, API versioning, and AI-driven image validation, ensuring a modern and efficient blogging experience.

#### 2. Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Caching**: Redis
- **API Documentation**: Swagger
- **Testing**: Bruno

#### 3. Key Features
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Admins can manage blog posts, categories, logos, and titles, while users can read posts, leave comments, and view content. Admins can also promote or demote user roles.
- **Advanced Capabilities**: Pagination & sorting, API versioning, Redis caching, rate limiting, AI-driven image validation, and custom exceptions for better debugging.
- **Documentation**: Detailed Swagger documentation and a pre-configured Bruno collection for API testing.

#### 4. Use Cases
- **Blog Management**: Organizations can use the API to create, read, update, and delete blog posts and categories.
- **User Interaction**: Users can read blog posts, leave comments, and interact with the content.
- **Admin Functions**: Admins can manage user roles and ensure the smooth operation of the blog platform.

#### 5. Areas of Improvement
- **Scalability**: Implementing more advanced caching mechanisms and optimizing database queries can enhance performance for high-traffic scenarios.
- **Security**: Regular security audits and updates to address any vulnerabilities can ensure the API remains secure.
- **Integration**: Expanding the API to support more integrations with third-party services can increase its versatility and usability in diverse environments.

## 2. Team B02

#### 1. Overview
The project demonstrates a microservices architecture for an e-commerce application. It includes three main services:
- **Product Service**: Manages product information.
- **Inventory Service**: Handles stock management.
- **Order Service**: Processes customer orders and coordinates with other services.

Each service operates independently and communicates via REST APIs. The project showcases a modular design that allows each service to scale independently and maintain its own database, ensuring decoupling and scalability.

#### 2. Tech Stack
- **Backende**: Java 11
- **Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Additional Tools**: Spring Cloud, Spring Data JPA, Spring Actuator, Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka

#### 3. Key Features
- **Product Service**: CRUD operations for product management.
- **Inventory Service**: Tracks and updates product stock levels.
- **Order Service**: Processes orders and validates stock availability.
- **Scalable Design**: Each microservice is modular and can be scaled independently.
- **Database Separation**: Each service has its own database to ensure decoupling.

#### 4. Use Cases
- **E-commerce Platform**: Facilitates the creation and management of an online store with products, inventory, and order processing.
- **Inventory Management**: Helps businesses manage stock levels and ensure product availability.
- **Order Processing**: Validates and processes customer orders, ensuring a smooth transaction flow.

#### 5. Areas of Improvement
- **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling mechanisms to provide more informative and user-friendly error messages.
- **API Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the APIs.
- **Testing**: Increase test coverage, particularly integration tests, to ensure robust interactions between microservices.
- **Security**: Strengthen security measures, such as implementing OAuth2 for secure API access and ensuring data encryption both in transit and at rest.
- **Performance Optimization**: Analyze and optimize the performance of APIs to handle larger volumes of requests efficiently.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Improve monitoring and logging to quickly identify and resolve issues in a production environment.
